        Hello, my name is Tricia Sawyer and I am currently a student at DeltaV code school, studying software development. I will graduate in July of 2023. Before that, I was a college student at Kirkwood Community College where I received my associates of Liberal Arts. Software development is something I chose to do right after I graduated, as I took some classes in tech and grew an interest. Along the way, I have gained experience using programming languages such as CSS, HTML, Javascript, React, and Bootstrap. With that, I plan to pursue a career in web development or mobile app creation. Through my educational experience, I have refined my skills in problem solving, collaboration, and time management.
