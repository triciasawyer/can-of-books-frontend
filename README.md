## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Team Agreement

Logistical
What hours will you be available to communicate?
Tim - 6am to 11pm
Tricia - 8am to 8pm
Bryan - 9am to 8pm

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack

How often will you take breaks?
Hourly check-ins, or after you finish your feature.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Lean on each other and ask for help.
Work together to catch up.
Communicate!

Cooperative
Make a list of each person's strengths (edit throughout project).
Tim - Backend JS
Tricia - Frontend JS
Bryan - Frontend JS

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
We can come together to each use our own strengths. Push each other to practice on our weaknesses, and help others understand their weaknesses.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Tim - Naming and organizing code to then move forward smoother when passing them.
Tricia - Naming and knowing what and where to pass them.
Bryan - Naming and overall organization in the code.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Using resources like the trello board, and then clearly under stand what each other are working on.

Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Check in on the trello boards and just make sure we’re all pretty much on the same page.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Communicate that and check in! Make sure everyone is up to date in the labs.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Communicate on where you’re at, like when finishing a feature, and just check throughout. Understanding that we all have our strengths and weaknesses and helping each other as well as taking that help from others that could teach us.
